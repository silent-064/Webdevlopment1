Full-Stack Web Development – Daily Learnings
Welcome to my Full-Stack Web Development Daily Learnings repository!

This is my personal journey of becoming a full-stack web developer. Here I regularly upload what I learn each day — from front-end technologies like HTML/CSS/JavaScript to back-end tools like Node.js, databases, and more.

📅 Daily Updates
I update this repository daily with code, notes, small projects, and key concepts I learn. This helps me track my progress and build consistency.
